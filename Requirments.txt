Sunlytics 2.0 is a data-driven project that combines **GIS mapping, regression models, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard** to analyze solar energy potential, electrification status of villages, and urban energy usage.  

---

## Features

- **Village Dashboard**: Explore electrification levels, solar potential, and predicted savings for rural areas.  
- **Urban Dashboard**: Visualize energy consumption, building types, and CO₂ savings in urban regions.  
- **Regression Model**: Predict potential solar energy savings based on geographic and demographic data.  
- **GIS Integration**: Interactive QGIS maps for urban and village analysis.  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Helps plan solar energy deployment and track community impact.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sunlytics-2.0.git
cd sunlytics-2.0
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
# Activate
# Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Dashboard
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The dashboard will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Navigate through Urban and Village tabs to explore data and predictions.

Data
URBAN_DATA.csv – Urban energy and building dataset.

VILLAGE_DATA.csv – Village electrification and solar potential dataset.

SUNLYTICS.2.0.qgz – QGIS project file for visualization.

⚠️ Large datasets can be hosted externally (Google Drive / Kaggle) if required.

Deployment
The app can be deployed publicly using Streamlit Community Cloud.

Once deployed, the app link can be shared with anyone to access on any device.
